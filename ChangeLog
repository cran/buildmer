1.2

** Proper environment support
** glmertree support
* More formal support for diagonal covariance structures via a new 'groups'
  argument to tabulate.formula
* Retire the 'quiet' argument
* Overhaul documentation
* Significantly improve family handling
* Allow 'include' to take a tabulated formula
* conv() now accepts a singular.ok argument, which is always FALSE inside
  buildmer
. Improve REML detection
. Increase robustness with user-provided formula tab
. Make convergence checks more consistent between model types
. Rework add.terms and related random-effects detection to fix obscure bug
  when tabulating non-r.e. terms that fool lme4::findbars (e.g. 'ar1(x|g)')

1.1

** Large rewrite of internal code organization. You can now specify arbitrary
   fitting functions, criteria, and elimination functions.
* Add 'include' argument to force terms to always be in the formula (fixes
  github bug #1)
* New function 'buildcustom'
* Added raw log-likelihood as a criterion: 'LL'
. Fix bug in calculating anova table with lmerTest ddf options
. Make calcWald respect numerator df in anova table
. Remove incorrect gradient check for mgcv models in conv(), instead check for
  'full convergence' string
