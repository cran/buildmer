1.3

** GLMMadaptive support
** lme models (package nlme) now have full support for the random part as well
* glmertree models now have full support for stepwise elimination
* calc.anova is now FALSE by default. Most users will not use it anyway, and
  for some lmerTest-based models it can cause an error.
* It is now (experimentally) possible to pass REML=FALSE to all buildmer
  functions to disable REML detection and always use ML. This may be useful if
  you are fitting GLMMs using glmmTMB and do not want to use their REML
  approximation.
. Nonconvergence of the fixed-effects part of the term-ordering step is now
  handled properly
. Fix bugs in order() and forward() breaking ML-only GLMM fits (GitHub issue #2)
. The 'include' argument was not being processed correctly when a cluster was
  provided. This is now fixed.

1.2.1

. Avoid the use of reformulate(), as its env= argument is only available on R
  >= 3.6 (bug reported by Willemijn Heeren)
. Relax the convergence checks for negative eigenvalues (affects mgcv and
  glmmTMB models)
. Improve detection of random effects
. Remove terms by block when a reference model fails to converge and detect
  empty models

1.2

** Proper environment support
** glmertree support
* More formal support for diagonal covariance structures via a new 'groups'
  argument to tabulate.formula
* Retire the 'quiet' argument
* Overhaul documentation
* Significantly improve family handling
* Allow 'include' to take a tabulated formula
* conv() now accepts a singular.ok argument, which is always FALSE inside
  buildmer
. Improve REML detection
. Increase robustness with user-provided formula tab
. Make convergence checks more consistent between model types
. Rework add.terms and related random-effects detection to fix obscure bug
  when tabulating non-r.e. terms that fool lme4::findbars (e.g. 'ar1(x|g)')

1.1

** Large rewrite of internal code organization. You can now specify arbitrary
   fitting functions, criteria, and elimination functions.
* Add 'include' argument to force terms to always be in the formula (fixes
  github bug #1)
* New function 'buildcustom'
* Added raw log-likelihood as a criterion: 'LL'
. Fix bug in calculating anova table with lmerTest ddf options
. Make calcWald respect numerator df in anova table
. Remove incorrect gradient check for mgcv models in conv(), instead check for
  'full convergence' string
